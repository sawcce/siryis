# WIP! Not ready for production
# Siryis

Siryis is a programming language made for the 2023 eso-jam hosted on
Truttle1's discord server!  

The theme given for this jam was "everyday life", so this language mimics
the way you'd plan out your day and uses a lingo closer to real life
rather than programming

## Hello, world!

A simple "Hello, world!" program in Siryis:

```srs
procedure Day
    -> Say: "Hello, world!"
```
